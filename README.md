# Simple Youtube Downloader
My goal was to create a simple website that I can use to download Youtube videos either as Video or as mp3.
In backend we use [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).
We use yt-dlp because the download rate is much higher.

You can see the website here: https://ytdl.dasevoli.com

The small .py file exists for me to delete all output files on my server and is completely optional.

# Requirements
* PHP >= 8.0
* ffmpeg
* ffprobe
* yt-dlp

# Requirements
* HTML contains a .mp4 file and a .gif that needs to be replaced
* Webserver for PHP
